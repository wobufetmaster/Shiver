## What is this? 
This is an LLM frontend, written with phoenix liveview. 

## Installation: 

You need to install elixir, and phoenix, follow the instructions here. https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html

You can ignore the postgres stuff, we only need elixir and phoenix.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wobufetmaster/Shiver
cd shiver
mix deps.get
mix phx.server
```

(Docker support coming soon hopefully!)
